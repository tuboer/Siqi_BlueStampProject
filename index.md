# Smart Glasses
<!---Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!-->

My project is the Smart Glasses, that can allow you to identify objects in front of you, take pictures, and play video games. It can also display time, and other information you want. thumbs up

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project-->

<br>**Components:**
I'm using the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and Camera Module to run the Object Recognition Software. This is all possible by using a MicroSd card inside the RaspPi. 

**Technical Progress:**
Some progress I've made is running the Camera Module, and displaying the camera on the VNC I'm using. I connected my computer to a monitor through VNC, which allows me to use the monitor remotely. The program succesfully shows the image detected, what it thinks the object is, and confidence meter.

**Challenges:**
One challenge I faced is that there was no confidence meter. I had to add that in with a new line of code. I did this by multiplying the confidence threshold inside the code by 100 to display the percentage. Another problem I faced was that the detector was displaying objects even when there was a low percentage of confidence. So I raised the confidence threshold, as well as the persistence threshold. The persistence threshold determines how much the object stays inside the screen, and the larger it is, the less likely it is to identify an object off screen. That also solved the problem where the camera was very laggy due to the large processes it was doing. A very big challenge though was that the library I was using was very outdated and inaccurate, which is why I want to change it in the future.

**Future Plan:**
My future plan is hopefully to use AI recognition in the future for more accurate identification, as well as using an OLED to display things through lenses instead of a monitor.


# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
<!---Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs.-->
This is the code from the guide that I used for TensorFlow Lite object recognition, and the modifications I made to it.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [TensorFlow Lite Object Recognition](https://learn.adafruit.com/running-tensorflow-lite-on-the-raspberry-pi-4/overview)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
